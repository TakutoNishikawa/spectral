Implementations of spectral learning algorithms for hidden Markov models and binning script for real-valued observations.

This code stems from the work for my master thesis "Implementing spectral methods for hidden Markov models with real-valued emissions" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7472). The master thesis covers both theoretical considerations about spectral learning algorithms and evaluates the two algorithms [1] and [2] using synthetic experimental data.

The algorithms were proposed in 

[1] Hsu, Daniel, Sham M. Kakade, and Tong Zhang. "A spectral algorithm for learning hidden Markov models." Journal of Computer and System Sciences 78.5 (2012): 1460-1480.

and
